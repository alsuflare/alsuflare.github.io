Euler-Lagrangian Formulation is yet another method that one can utilize to derive equations of motion of a certain system. Euler-Lagrangian equations become particularly useful when the system of interest is comprised of complicated forces. The best way to prove and understand this scope of classical mechanics is through calculus of variations. As this book is not a math textbook, we will start with a brief introduction to variational principles, then establish the Euler-Lagrangian formulation of mechanics. 

## Brief introduction to calculus of variations
Suppose a certain quantity of interest is expressable as an integral. The calculus of variations is essentially concerned with finding the extrema of the quantity.
